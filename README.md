# SilverTimer_PWA

Basic web version of the [SilverTimer app](https://www.holzapfel-online.de/silvertimer/)

The web app is hosted via GitHub Pages and can be started via this [link](https://ceotjoe.github.io/SilverTimer_PWA/).

The app is intended to calculate the necessary time to reach a desired PPM concentration of silver colloid in water.

Just enter the current in mA, amount of water in ml and the desired PPM. After clicking the calculate button it will show the time in which the electrolysis is finished.

It is possible to add the app as PWA to tho home screen of mobile devices like android or iOS.

If you're using the timer function, this is currently only working in the foreground. Means the page needs to be open all the time until the timer is finished.

This app was developed as a proof of concept for AI supported development with the help of [Grok AI](https://grok.com).
